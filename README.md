## Features

- 🖥️ **Easy-to-use GUI** – No command-line needed!
- 🔍 **Fast duplicate detection** using file size and MD5 hash
- 📂 **Exclude folders** from the scan (e.g., system or backup directories)
- 📝 **Dry-run mode** – Preview what would be moved before actual changes
- 📄 **Detailed log file** saved after each scan

---

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher

**Standard Python libraries used (no extra installation required):**
- `tkinter`
- `hashlib`
- `shutil`
- `os`
- `logging`

### Steps

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/duplicate-file-finder.git
    cd duplicate-file-finder
    ```

2. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python duplicate_finder.py
    ```

---

## Usage

1. **Select the folder** you want to scan.
2. *(Optional)* Enter folders to exclude, separated by commas.
3. *(Optional)* Enable **Dry-run mode** to preview actions.
4. Click **Start Scanning**.
5. View results in the window and check the log file (`duplicates_log.txt`) in your selected folder.

---

## How It Works

- The app scans all files in the chosen folder (and subfolders).
- It ignores any folders you specify in the exclude list.
- Duplicate files (by size and MD5 hash) are **moved** to a `duplicates` subfolder inside your chosen folder.
- In **dry-run mode**, no files are moved-actions are only simulated and logged.

## Example

```
Folder to Scan: /Users/yourname/Documents
Exclude Folders: /Users/yourname/Documents/Backups, /Users/yourname/Documents/System
[✓] Dry-run mode

Result:
Dry-run: Duplicate found - /Users/yourname/Documents/Photos/img1.jpg (would be moved to /Users/yourname/Documents/duplicates/img1.jpg)
...
```
